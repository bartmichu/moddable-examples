# Simple Moddable SDK examples and experiments

This repository contains my coding experiments focused on exploring microcontrollers, electronics basics, the Moddable SDK, and JavaScript programming in general.

I'm using devices based on the Espressif ESP8266 and ESP32, as well as the Raspberry Pi Pico. Different examples have been tested on various boards, and you can find specific details in the notes section of each `main.js` file.

Examples with names ending in `_io` utilize the io module, while those ending in `_j5e` utilize the j5e framework.
